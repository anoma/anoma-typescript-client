* Anoma TS-Client

This is an example TS client that is pegged to a certain Anoma
release. Please read [[https://github.com/anoma/anoma][the Anoma Anoma]] repository


** GRPC-Web

I was originally using this, however it seems not to support running
off the web browser well.

** Dependencies
#+begin_src shell
  npm install grpc_tools_node_protoc_ts --save-dev
  npm install protoc-gen-grpc-ts
  npm install protoc-gen-js
#+end_src

** Getting new proto files
Run the shell script in ~scripts/~, and move the files into the root
directory.

** Using the Project
#+begin_src shell
  npx ts-node -P ./
#+end_src
